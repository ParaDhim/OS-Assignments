NAME         top

       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS         top

       rm [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION         top

       This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes

       each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.



       If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are

       more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given,

       then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire

       operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire

       command is aborted.



       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal,

       and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or

       --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for

       whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative,

       the file is skipped.

OPTIONS         top
Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
       -i     prompt before every removal
